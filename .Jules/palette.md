## 2025-05-23 - Accessibility: Skip to Content
**Learning:** Single Page Applications (SPAs) often miss the "Skip to content" link because the header is a component and not just static HTML. It needs to be the first interactive element.
**Action:** Always check `App.tsx` or the main layout file for a "Skip to content" link, especially in apps with fixed headers.
